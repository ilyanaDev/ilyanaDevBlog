Steve Smith's Pluralsight course Creating N-Tier Applications in C#, Part 2 goes into more detail about N-Tier Applications.

I recently completed **[Creating N-Tier Applications in C#, Part 2](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/n-tier-csharp-part2/table-of-contents)** by Steve Smith.

Here are [my notes](https://ilyana.dev/blog/2020-07-16-creating-ntier-applications-csharp-1/) from **[Creating N-Tier Applications in C#, Part 1](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/n-tier-apps-part1/table-of-contents)**.

Here are my notes from Part 2:

Testing
--

- Unit tests in an n-tier application should generally only care about one of your tiers (which should be in its own project file); integration tests will likely care about several tiers, and possibly also have some external dependencies on databases, etc.
- Mocks are a useful tool in unit tests, but should generally be used for tests of behavior, rather than tests of state
- If you're working in a shared repository, you should run all tests before checking in (also, make sure you're using the latest version and make sure your code builds)

Persistence
--

- All objects in an application are constructed, then spend some time being active and perhaps are modified. Finally they are disposed of.
- Objects should know nothing about if/how they are persisted (SRP!)
- It's important that objects are consistent throughout the application
  - This is most applicable in scenarios where changes are made and then saved
- "An interface should be designed to make the wrong things hard and the right things easy."
- Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) (e.g. Microsoft Entity Framework)
  - Code-First Entity Framework - create entities and tell Entity Framework to map them to the database
- Consider [The Repository Pattern](https://ilyana.dev/blog/2020-10-12-repository-pattern/) and/or [The Unit of Work Pattern](https://ilyana.dev/blog/2020-10-14-unit-of-work-pattern/)

Core Logic Reuse
--

- "Holy Grail of Software" = code reuse
  - software components should be like LEGOs
- Dependency Inversion Principle -> depend on interfaces, not specific implementation
  - related to IOC containers, which are essentially "factories on steroids"
  - aids code reuse
- DTO = Data Transfer Object - typically a class full of data, no behavior
