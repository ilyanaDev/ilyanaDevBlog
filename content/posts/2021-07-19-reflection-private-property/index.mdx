When testing a class, you often need to assign a value to a property - a property which you wouldn't otherwise want to allow to be set. In this scenario, reflection can be a valuable tool.

## Reflection? What's that?

Reflection is a tool in C# that can be used to access the metadata of a class. It has a number of uses, but it should generally be used as a last resort, as there are some drawbacks. Using reflection can lead to some performance limitations. More importantly, reflection - as you'll see below - allows you to access properties marked as private, protected, internal, etc. Theoretically, those properties were marked as such for a reason, so it's not necessarily a great idea to go and mess with that encapsulation.

However, in this case, we have a good reason: testing. Test code can bend rules that production code cannot. Below is a good use-case scenario for reflection.

## The Problem

Imagine a `Member` class in a gym's user management appliection. A `Member` probably has some basic properties like `Name`, `Email`, `SubscriptionPlan`, etc. Another important property might be `DateJoined`.

```csharp
public class Member
{
  public string Name {get; set;}
  public string Email {get; set;}
  public SubscriptionPlan SubscriptionPlan {get; set;}
  public DateTime DateJoined {get; private set;}

  public Member(string name, string email, SubscriptionPlan subscriptionPlan)
  {
    Name = name;
    Email = email;
    SubscriptionPlan = subscriptionPlan;
    DateJoined = DateTime.Today;
  }

  // other code here
}
```

Above, `DateJoined` has a private setter and is set to `DateTime.Today` in the constructor. There is virtually no scenario in which you would want to change the value of `DateJoined`. Therefore, there is no reason to give this property a public setter and it is probably a bad idea to do so.

Alright, fair enough. But what if I want to test the `CheckIfMemberNeedsAnniversaryGift` method of `AnniversaryGiftService`? Now things get tricky.

```csharp
public class AnniversaryGiftService
{
  public void SendGiftIfNeeded(Member member)
  {
    if (CheckIfMemberNeedsAnniversaryGift(member)) SendAnniversaryGift();
  }

  public bool CheckIfMemberNeedsAnniversaryGift(Member member)
  {
    return (member.DateJoined.Day == DateTime.Today.Day &&
      member.DateJoined.Month == DateTime.Today.Month);
  }

  public void SendAnniversaryGift()
  {
    // some code
  }
}
```

As you can see, the logic of `CheckIfMemberNeedsAnniversaryGift` is entirely dependent on `member`'s `DateJoined`. But as discussed above, `DateJoined` has a private setter. So how can we test this method?

You guessed it - reflection!

## The Solution

One implementation of reflection, which we will use here, involves using extension methods to set the private `DateJoined` property of `Member`:

```csharp
public static class ReflectionHelperExtensionMethods
{
  // from https://stackoverflow.com/a/1565766/13680266
  public static void SetPrivateDateTimePropertyValue(this Member member, string propName, DateTime newValue)
  {
    PropertyInfo propertyInfo = typeof(Member).GetProperty(propName);
    if (propertyInfo == null) return;
    propertyInfo.SetValue(member, newValue);
  }
}
```

Essentially, the above code scans the metadata of the `Member` class to find a property of the name passed in. In this case, we would pass `"DateJoined"`, and then the `SetValue` method above would set that property to `newValue`, without regard for that property being marked `private`.

*If you're unfamiliar with extension methods, [this article](https://ardalis.com/keep-tests-short-and-dry-with-extensions/) provides a nice overview of their use in tests.*

Finally, here is the test we can write now that the reflection extension method is set up:

```csharp
public static class AnniversaryGiftServiceCheckIfMemberNeedsAnniversaryGift
{
  // other code omitted

  [Test]
  public void ReturnsTrueGivenMemberWithDateJoined1YearAgo
  {
    var testMember = new Member("testName", "testEmail", "testSubscriptionPlan");

    // use reflection to set DateJoined property
    testMember.SetPrivateDateTimePropertyValue("DateJoined", DateTime.Today.AddYears(-1));

    var memberNeedsAnniversaryGift = _anniversaryGiftService.CheckIfMemberNeedsAnniversaryGift(testMember);

    Assert.True(memberNeedsAnniversaryGift);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

This was a pretty simple use case. In fact, we could have omitted the `propName` parameter of `SetPrivateDateTimePropertyValue` and renamed it to `SetDateJoinedPropertyValue`:

```csharp
// from https://stackoverflow.com/a/1565766/13680266
public static void SetDateJoinedPropertyValue(this Member member, DateTime newValue)
{
  PropertyInfo propertyInfo = typeof(Member).GetProperty("DateJoined");
  if (propertyInfo == null) return;
  propertyInfo.SetValue(member, newValue);
}
```

However, this diminishes flexibility later on if `Member` gets more complex and has more `DateTime` properties with private setters, like a `DateOfSubscriptionExpiration`, for example. The `propName` parameter allows us to use the above method with more flexibility in a more complex and less contrived use case.
