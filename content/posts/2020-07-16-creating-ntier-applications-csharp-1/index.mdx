Steve Smith's Pluralsight course Creating N-Tier Applications in C#, Part 1 does a great job of explaining the basics of N-Tier applications.

I recently completed **[Creating N-Tier Applications in C#, Part 1](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/n-tier-apps-part1/table-of-contents)** by Steve Smith. Here are my notes:

Application Evolution
--

* N Tier refers to a system composed of some n number of layers
  * Most commonly 3 - UI, Business Logic, Data Access Logic
  * Separated tiers are logically separated. Sometimes also physically separated. Sometimes separate deployment and even separate development
* "Tier" and "Layer" more or less interchangeable
  * "Layer" can be applied specifically to logical structure of application
  * "Tier" can be applied specifically to the physical structure of the system
* Logical separation:
  * code organization
  * namespaces, classes, folders, assemblies, etc.
  * a software design pattern
* Physical separation:
  * infrastructure organization
  * separate physical processes, machines, devices
  * a software architecture
  * generally impossible without logical separation
* Benefits:
  * improved productivity via reuse
  * improved productivity via team segmentation
  * improved maintainability
  * looser coupling
  * more physical deployment options
* Drawbacks and Risks:
  * reduced performance, esp. when physically separated
  * more complex design
  * more complex deployment
* Coupling:
  * loose coupling allows connected modules to change independently of one another
  * tight coupling describes when changes in one module require changes in others
    * avoid this
  * Follow principles of object-oriented design to facilitate loose coupling
* End runs - when one application layer calls to another that is not directly below it
  * avoid this!
  * and avoid allowing concerns from one layer to leak up to a higher layer - information hiding!
  * end runs -> no advantage gained from n-tier design (but lots of disadvantage)
* Monolithic application
  * n-tier where n = 1
  * no logical or physical separation of concerns
  * all parts of the application are included

Data-Centric N-Tier Design
--

* Problems this design can help with:
  * no easy way to test notification business logic
  * duplicated and/or tightly coupled logic
  * changes to one portion of a system requiring changes to another portion
* Refactoring to N-tier design:
  * Identify your layers
  * Push your code from the original file into these layers
* *This module is mostly demos*

Domain-Centric N-Tier Design
--

* Domain-Centric Design
  * focused on domain
    * problem-space of application = domain
  * objects you design to model domain = domain objects = model objects
    * should describe problem domain, include any required business logic
    * do not depend on external infrastructure
* Refactor to invert dependencies from a data-centric N-tier design:
  * create projects for core and infrastrucutre
  * move BLL methods to core or infrastructure services
  * create interfaces for dependencies and provide them to classes via constructors
  * push object graph creation to UI layer
* Onion architecture = ports and adapters architecture = hexagonal architecture
* Onion architecture principles:
  * all code depends on layers closer to center
  * domain model at center
  * inner layers define interfaces, outer layers implement those interfaces - abstraction!
  * layered behavior around the domain model
  * infrastructure and UI concerns pushed to end
    * depend on Application Core, not vice versa
* Repository pattern used for infrastructure concerns related to persistence
* Domain-Centric design from scratch:
  * create a blank solution
  * add a core class library project
  * add an infrastructure class library project
  * add your UI project
  * add references to core from infrastructure and UI
  * add reference to infrastructure from UI (if needed)

Summary
--

* N-Tier Design = logical and physical separation of responsibilities within an application
* Layers = logical separation for maintainability
* Tiers = physical separation for scalability, security, fault tolerance, etc.
* Applications can evolve over time
* Avoid end runs around layers of your design
* Duplication can be eliminated via refactoring to N-tier design
* Concerns should be separated between layers
* Layers should communicate with one another via well-defined, cohesive interfaces
* domain-centric design focuses on your application's domain logic
* dependency injection can be used to put application logic at the center of the dependencies
  * used well with strategy pattern
* domain-centric design leads to easier testing
* much easier to start with domain-centric design than to refactor to it later
* here are my [notes](https://ilyana.dev/blog/2020-10-20-creating-ntier-applications-csharp-2/) from **[Creating N-Tier Applications in C#, Part 2](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/n-tier-csharp-part2/table-of-contents)**.
