Why do I want Google Analytics?
--

Google Analytics will give you the ability to see how many users your site gets and which parts of your site they look at most. It's also pretty easy to connect to your Gatsby blog using it in combination with Google Tag Manager and the Gatsby plugin for Google Tag Manager.

How to Connect your Blog
--

First, you'll need both a Google Analytics and a Google Tag Manager account, as well as a Gatsby blog, which you can learn how to build [here](https://ilyana.dev/blog/2020-06-17-creating-gatsby-blog-netlify). Once that's taken care of, follow along with the first 4 minutes of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__PctBcNZ-c) to configure Tag Manager for your Gatsby blog.

Here are some links to the websites you'll want to have open in order to follow along:

* [Gatsby Google Tag Manager Plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-google-tagmanager/)
* [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/)
* [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
