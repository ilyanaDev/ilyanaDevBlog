The String Calculator Kata is a great kata for practicing test-driven development. In this kata, you spend 30 minutes trying to complete as many of the 9 sections as possible, but the idea is that you never read ahead - only read the step you're on. You can view the instructions [here](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/master/katas/String%20Calculator.md).

This attempt, I got through 5 sections. That's the same number as last time, but I was able to get some work done on section 6, unlike last time. Hopefully sometime soon I'll get to a point where I can do all nine!

For a more in-depth description of how to get a kata started in C#, check out the start of [my post on the FizzBuzz kata](https://ilyana.dev/blog/2020-06-22-fizzbuzz-kata-PPP/).

I found this kata to be very helpful, and I will definitely try it again in the future to try to beat my performance from this attempt. Best of luck to you if you decide to try it!
