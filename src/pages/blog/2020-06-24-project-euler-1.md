[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a great resource for anyone looking to brush up their programming and mathematics skills. They have over 700 problems of varying difficulty.

I recently completed problem 1, which you can access [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).

To get set up with Project Euler, you'll want to make an account (it's optional, but you can't track progress without it). To do so, go to [Project Euler's homepage](https://projecteuler.net/) and click **Register** at the top. You'll be prompted to set up a username and password and then you're ready to start solving problems!

To start coding in C#, I used [Ardalis's Project Euler Starter](https://github.com/ardalis/EulerCSharpStarter) to get my files all set up, which worked very well. If you want to keep your Project Euler work on a GitHub repository, check out [my post](https://ilyana.dev/blog/2020-06-24-connecting-github/) on connecting your GitHub repository to your desktop.

Best of luck to you as you work through Project Euler!
