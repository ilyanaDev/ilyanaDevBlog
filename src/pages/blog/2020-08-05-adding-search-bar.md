There are many, many, many ways to add search capability to your website. I implemented pretty much the most quick-and-dirty approach here, though I may try to update it in the future. All I did was add an HTML form with the Action attribute to my site's footer. The input links to a Google search of just the ilyana.dev site. You can see my code [here](https://github.com/ilyanaDev/ilyanaDevBlog/commit/d9fdee3ead95fbcc3f774715d14bd81aa4d7109b).

If you're looking to learn more about the HTML form Action attribute, W3Schools has a pretty useful [web environment](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_form_action) where you can explore the attribute.

I wanted to implement [this approach](https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/create-gatsby-blog-search-tutorial#getting-started) from [Monica Powell](https://www.aboutmonica.com/) using React but couldn't seem to get it to work even after quite a bit of trial-and-error (mostly because I am very unfamiliar with React). If you decide to go this route, I hope you'll have more luck than I did; it's certainly a very aesthetic search capability, and I may try implementing it again if I can get more familiar with React.

Thanks for reading! I hope you find this and other articles here at ilyanaDev helpful! Be sure to follow me on Twitter [@ilyanaDev](https://twitter.com/ilyanaDev).
