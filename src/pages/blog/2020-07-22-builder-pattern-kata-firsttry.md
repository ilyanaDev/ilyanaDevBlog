The instructions and source code for the kata can be found [here](https://github.com/ardalis/BuilderTestSample).

This kata took me over an hour, since I've never done anything with the Builder pattern before. However, after completing this kata, I now understand the Builder Pattern and its applications far more than I did previously, even after watching several videos and reading several articles about it. If you'd like to see [my code](https://github.com/ilyanaDev/KataPractice/tree/master/BuilderPatternKata/2020-07-22) from this attempt, visit [my GitHub](https://github.com/ilyanaDev).

If you'd like to read more about the Builder Pattern, there's an article about it [here](https://ilyana.dev/blog/2020-07-21-builder-pattern/) on my blog!

Another great resource is [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FYthBodusg) of Brendan Enrick streaming his attempt at this kata.
