What is GitHub?
-

GitHub is a wonderful platform for collaboration and file organization. GitHub is based on the git system, which is a system developers use to maintain past versions of software, etc. Although it is most commonly used by developers, git is a great system for storing past versions of many types of files.

Getting Started with GitHub
-

Like so many websites, GitHub *optimizes for new users*. This is good news for you! When you visit github.com, the most prominent feature of the page is a signup sheet. All you need are a unique username, your email, and a secure password, and you'll be all set to use GitHub!

Configuring Your GitHub Account
-

Once you have a GitHub account, you'll want to visit the **Profile** page to add additional information if you'd like other users to know more about you. To edit your profile, click the icon at the top right corner of your screen. For new users, this will be a pixelated image like this one:

From here, you'll want to click **Your Profile**. Now, you can click the **Edit Profile** button to the left side of your screen, but this button will only allow you to edit your bio, company, location, website, and Twitter username. However, if you'd like to make additional changes, simply click the avatar icon above the **Edit Profile** button instead.

Once you are at the **Public Profile** page, it's easy to make changes to many aspects of your profile.

There is one very important change I recommend making to your account at this point. You should click **Security** on the left-hand side of the screen. From this menu, scroll down to Two-Factor Authentication and decide what method you'd like to use to further secure your account. The authenticator app is likely the simplest, but security keys and sms messaging are also options.

If you decide to enable two-factor authentication, you'll have to install the app of your choice on your mobile device. Some good examples include DUO Mobile and Authy. You can use the app of your choice to scan the provided QR code, and you're all set!

Finishing Up
---

Using the git system is fairly simple once you get used to it, but it does take some time to learn exactly what you should be doing. I'd recommend doing some I'd like to mention that one thing that tripped me up for awhile as I tried to link some desktop files in VS Code to a GitHub repository. If you have this problem, where your command line wants you to sign into your GitHub account, but it isn't accepting your password, you can create a Personal Access Token instead. [This link](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) has excellent step-by-step instructions on how to do this.
