## HTML in VS Code

VS Code automatically provides Intellisense, etc. for HTML code. It does not have automatic preview capability, but plenty of extensions are available to provide that. I ended up using this one, which works pretty well:

## HTML Syntax

I've used HTML a bit before, so I'm not going to go into the minutiae of the syntax (if you're interested in that, [this](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) is a pretty solid intro), but I will note some of the features I hadn't used before this point.

### Doctype Declaration

It's weird that I didn't know this, but apparently HTML documents are supposed to start with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Again, weird that I didn't know that, but live and learn.

### Comments

```html
<!--- This is a comment in HTML-->
This is not a commment in HTML
```

### Applying CSS

You have to tell your HTML to use the CSS style sheet you want it to use (makes sense, right?). The syntax for that is pretty straightforward:

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```
