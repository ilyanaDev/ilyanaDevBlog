description: I've had an issue a couple of times now where I'm working with a forked repository on GitHub, and whenever I make a pull request, a bunch of "merge" commits show up in addition to the commit where I actually made the changes.

This is, of course, not ideal, since it really clutters up the pull requests and can be confusing for the person reviewing them. Luckily, it's a pretty easy fix with a few command line statements, as described in [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9646167/clean-up-a-fork-and-restart-it-from-the-upstream).
