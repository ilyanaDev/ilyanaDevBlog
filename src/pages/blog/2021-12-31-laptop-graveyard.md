I've only included one previous laptop so far, but I plan to update this post in the future.

## HP Spectre

I've had this laptop for about 6 years now, and it's been a fantastic laptop and really been everything I needed in a laptop for all of high school and part of college. However, when the hard drive filled up, it was time to get a new one. Which is a shame, because I was very proud of the stickers I decorated this laptop with.
