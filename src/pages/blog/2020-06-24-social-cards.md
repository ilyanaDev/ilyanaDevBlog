Social cards are pretty cool when they work. But you're probably wondering: What on Earth is a social card? Social cards are the auto-generated website previews that you see when a URL is sent via Twitter, Slack, Discord, etc. I recently fixed the ones for my blog so that instead of looking like this:

![Bad Social Card](/img/social-cards-bad.png "Bad Social Card")

They look like this:

![Good Social Card](/img/social-cards-good.png "Good Social Card")

[Here](https://github.com/ilyanaDev/ilyanaDevBlog/commit/de5ba0b52bbc33cfccf125f4b285f59b8f5d3208) are the changes I made to my code.

Thanks for reading! I hope you find this and other articles here at ilyanaDev helpful! Be sure to follow me on Twitter [@ilyanaDev](https://twitter.com/ilyanaDev).
