Hi! My name is Ilyana Smith. I'm a student studying aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan. I also plan to minor in computer science. Previously, I spent a year working for a software consulting company. Now I code for class and wish I had more time to code for fun. I enjoy sharing what I'm learning with you. I've only been coding for a few years, and I've learned a lot in that time, but I am definitely still a beginner, focusing mainly on C# and C++, with some experience in Java and web development. Wherever you are in your own journey, I hope you'll find what I share useful.

You can follow me on Twitter [@ilyanaDev](https://twitter.com/ilyanaDev).

In addition to computer science and aerospace engineering, I am also interested in documentary filmmaking. If that sounds interesting to you, be sure to take a look at my documentary, [*Up and Down the Years*](https://upanddowntheyears.com/), which tells the story of the Donauschwaben, a group of ethnic Germans expelled from their homelands in southeastern Europe following World War II.
